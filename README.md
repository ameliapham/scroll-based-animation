#  Three.js Scroll-Based 3D Background

This repository was created as part of a learning exercise to explore how Three.js can be used as a dynamic background for a classic HTML page.
The goal is to combine 3D rendering with traditional web scrolling to create a more immersive and interactive browsing experience.
This project demonstrates how scroll, cursor interaction, and animations can work together to bring a static page to life.

## ⭐ What this project does

This project uses Three.js as a background layer for an HTML page and synchronizes the camera and animations with user interactions.
It features:

	•	Parallax effects based on cursor movement
	•	Section-based animations triggered on scroll
	•	Multiple 3D objects distributed across scroll sections
	•	Particle system enhancing depth and atmosphere
    •	Smooth animations with GSAP
